**Task Manager allows the user to add and view tasks related to the day, modify them if necessary, and delete them as well
each task has a title, description, date and time, and is it finished or not?**

## Perpose

##### In this time, many of us are busy doing our tasks, maybe because they are busy with other things and maybe because they did not have a clear plan for what they will do during the day, so me and my colleague and I decided to take advantage of the technical skills gained from the Gaza Sky Geeks team and run them in developing a task manager to enable users to Create a clear plan of what they will do today with simple user interfaces that are easy to use by all potential users.
